# Fov-Effects-Scale-Mod
Backports the FOV Effects Scale to older versions of the game (listed in README)
by KingContaria

Works on Legacy Fabric

# Versions it works in:

1.8.9

Other versions may very well also work, I am just too lazy to test it. If you have tested it, you can message me on Discord (KingContaria#5081) and I will add it to the list.
